<pre>You know that I'm traumatized
See the pain fill your eyes
You changed my entire life
I messed up a hundred times
Same mistakes another night
Promises don't make it right
Another day another might
I just caught another flight
Can I please see you tonight
I'll forget all those of nights

So just dance with me baby can you hold me closely
Put me in trances the way you whisper that you love me
I cannot stand when we fight we leave each other lonely
So just dance with me baby
D-dance with me baby
Just dance with me baby can you hold me closely
Put me in trances the way you whisper that you love me
I cannot stand when we fight we leave each other lonely
So just dance with me baby, dan-
Dan-
Dan-
Dan-
Dance

You know I hate picking sides
Difference between you and I
Differences we put aside
I don't even want to fight
I just really want to try
To get through to you
Promise that there's nothing that we can't do
Promises to make it right
Just give me another night
See you in another life
Try but I keep doing wrong

I'm flying but I'm all alone
I cannot survive without my baby
Not for a moment more
I'm crying barely holdin' on
But I just caught another flight
Can I please see you tonight
We are running out of sight

So just dance with me baby can you hold me closely
Put me in trances the way you whisper that you love me
I cannot stand when we fight we leave each other lonely
So just dance with me baby
D-dance with me baby

Just dance with me baby can you hold me closely
Put me in trances the way you whisper that you love me
I cannot stand when we fight we leave each other lonely
So just dance with me baby, dan-
Dan-
Dan-
Dan-
Dance
