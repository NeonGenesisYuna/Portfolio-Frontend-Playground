<h1 class="girls">Girls</h1>
<h1>Girls typically refers to female children under the age of eighteen. The term however has long lost it's original meaning, as most people still call grown up women girls. In the early years of life, children mostly just know about boys and girls. A lot of young boys aren't that fond of girls at first, but the older boys get,
the more they're interested in girls. However, a lot of older boys also still tend to make jokes that objectify/downplay women, more recently also referred to as "toxic masculinity". The Wired community however has long broken these standards and have created a safespace where everybody can live in harmony,
without any discrimination between either parties. We obviously also include people of other gender preferences. We believe that accepting each other the way we are is an important lesson, which is sadly often overlooked nowadays. Furthermore, a lot of us believe that social acceptance is also a sign of intelligence, or rather
just common sense for adults (which more and more people nowadays don't seem to possess).</h1>
