<h1 class="weird">Weird</h1>

<h1>Weird people are often social outcasts. They are portrayed as different and often "wrong" by others, which leads them to get even "weirder". Most "weird" people eventually become social outcasts which have either a very small social bubble, or none at all. In our world where everyone is always connected to everything, "weird" people have
found comfort in the internet, where they can find other people who are being/have been treated the same as they have. The people they see in their everyday life don't matter to them anymore, as they can find a practically infinite number of like minded people on the internet. Sadly, due to this reliance on the internet, these people often struggle
when they have to deal with their real life. It can be very hard for such people to get into relationships or truly close friendships. How much these things impact those people however, is different from person to person.
