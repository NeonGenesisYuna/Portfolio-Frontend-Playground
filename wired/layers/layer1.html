<h1 class="weird">Weird</h1>

<pre>I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
    Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
    that everyone can see these scars
    I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
    But it's like, no matter what I do, I can't convince you
    to just believe this is real
    So I let go, watching you
    Turn your back like you always do
    Face away and pretend that I'm not
    But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

    I can't feel the way I did before
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
    Time won't heal this damage anymore
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

    I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
    'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can,
    but sometimes I don't make sense
    I am what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
    It's like, no matter what I do, I can't convince you
    for once just to hear me out
    So I let go, watching you
    Turn your back like you always do
    Face away and pretend that I'm not
    But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

    I can't feel the way I did before
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
    Time won't heal this damage anymore
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

    No, hear me out now
    You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
    Right now, hear me out now
    You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
    Right now (I can't feel the way I did before)
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

    I can't feel the way I did before
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
    Time won't heal this damage anymore
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
    I can't feel
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
    Time won't heal
    Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
