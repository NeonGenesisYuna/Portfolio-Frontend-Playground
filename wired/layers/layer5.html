<pre>
We are the children of the devolution
The infamous martyrs, the scars on the sun
Asphyxiating with a smile on your face
While they pull your teeth out one by one

Is this what you wanted? (No)
Do you want some more? (Yeah)
D-generation
Who's keeping score?

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear
But you should've known that this was gonna end in tears

Such a sucker for an execution
The void is a vampire, fat on our blood
Domesticated like a cat in a cage
While they try their hand at playing God

Is this what you wanted? (No)
Do you want some more? (Yeah)
D-generation
Afraid there's no cure

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear (oh)
But you should've known that this was gonna end in tears

I got my hands around your throat, I love the way you choke
'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go
My hands around your throat, I love the way you choke
'Cause I am yours and you are mine, I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go
Get the fuck up
Yeah

'Cause you got a taste now, drank the Kool-Aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, oh, come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you, oh, my dear (oh)
You should've known, you should've known

You should've known that this was gonna end in tears
You should've known

What if it's like
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la?
Oh, I forgot something

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, yeah
La-la-la
That this was gonna end in tears
Or some shit like that
