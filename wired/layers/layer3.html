I know it's all up in my head
It'll end soon, probably
What if I was dead?
What if they knew that I wanna be?
I'm so sorry
I feel like Omori, an anomaly
And honestly, we'll be there
For each other always, promise me

What do you say?
Guess I'm back to
Updating my journal every day
Really wish this feeling in me
Would just go away
From time to time, I try
Reminding myself everything's OK

For the most mundane things, I'll just cop out
Tell my closest friends: "Not now"
Hold that in as much as I can
But why can't I fucking just calm down?
And I'd rather dream than just live
That's just the way that it is
I don't know why I care at all
My heart just don't bleed as much as my wrist
Only want to say that I was finally good for something
Just in the hopes it wasn't all for nothing
Don't know how I changed this much
It feels so good just to be a shut in
But for them it doesn't, prolly 'cause I love it
They don't understand how much they push my buttons
They appreciate me all of a sudden
All the love they pour on me just doesn't cut it

Thought I want to grow up, ready but I wasn't
All my homies blow confetti by the dozen
Every bit of hope and joy are what we need
What if it's only me, look, I think I can feel the rush, and
I don't know if I have gotten better, lately
Why's it feel like everybody hates me?
All alone now, and I don't feel the safety
'Cause my inner demons always try to chase me

On my own, here again, that's me
Stuck in my dome with the friends I need
Not sure where to go, but I guess we'll see
Running out of hope, and it ends with me
Just know that means
That I'm thankful for all my friends
With them I'll be A-OK
Even if I have to pretend

Do you feel your heart beat faster
When your eyes close?
All the weight of everything gets trapped up
And you might blow
Do you feel that something isn't right?
Out of mind, out of sight
Tell me, what's wrong? What's right?
Fuck it, what's another lie?

Seal up your brain
And dissipate all your pain
Who cares if you see tomorrow
If it eases your mind today?
I might succumb
To a debt I could never pay
While waiting for shit to change
So that something would feel OK

In my head space, I remain safe
Put my walls up and pray
For a cure to my deadweight
For my friends' sake
Soon I'll be free
From the chains of my own mistakes
But for now I just lay
In the bed that I made!

Talk it through my head
Some things that I don't believe in
Wish it all away
But doesn't mean that I don't see them
My eyes have been clouded and blinded
Man, my head keeps spinning
Fate has been decided
Something that I don't agree with

Feeling is egregious
But, man, I guess that's me
They don't understand
The weight I feel's the weight they'll grieve
Is it freedom from the pressure?
The sweet kiss of death
Not sure of my intention
But I guess it's time I rest

Do you feel your heart beat faster
When your eyes close?
All the weight of everything gets trapped up
And you might blow
Do you feel that something isn't right?
Out of mind, out of sight
Tell me, what's wrong? What's right?
Fuck it, what's another lie?

Seal up your brain
And dissipate all your pain
Who cares if you see tomorrow
If it eases your mind today?
I might succumb
To a debt I could never pay
While waiting for shit to change
So that something would feel OK

In my head space, I remain safe
Put my walls up and pray
For a cure to my deadweight
For my friends' sake
Soon I'll be free
From the chains of my own mistakes
But for now I just lay
In the bed that I made!

You make nothing mean
Something to me
My pain and
My grief
Will you
Please set me free?
They're nothing
To me
