--Website URL:

As mentioned in the previous exam, ignore the .idea file for the same reasons stated previously.

I will continue working on this site, as I've grown quite interested in webdesign, so that's why some of the sites aren't finished yet.

The folder "topsecret" currently doesn't have anything of note in it and also has an old layout, so ignore that one.

The folder "spotifydatabase" was my attempt at trying to display my own spotify data (top songs/artists from the past 4 weeks) on a website with the spotify API
and a python library (spotipy) which I haven't gotten to work properly yet. However, I've attached a file "readme_attachment.jpg", in which I got it to work with a local flask server.
I attached the image so you can still grade the css part of it, without having to replicate the whole thing. (Also I just meshed two screenshots together,
it actually shows the top 10 songs/artists, not just three like in the file, just to clarify).

The "layers" folder isn't completed yet and the layer files don't have anything besides a background image after layer 5.

The "dreams" site is also not quite finished yet, as it is still very new.

And a little funfact, all the audio files in the "wired-soundtrack" site (resp. the "soundtrack" folder) are songs that I'm currently working on for an album which
I'm planning to release when I'm done with all thirteen songs.



What I didn't code on my own (or what I still don't fully understand and needed heavy help with from external sources):

Every animation that was made with the .glitch class

The CSS part of "wired-soundtrack" that interacts with the JS, and some of the JS part itself (I know JS doesn't get graded)


Other small things:

The scroll bar for the playlist in wired-soundtrack looks way better in firefox than in chrome.

There probably is more inconsistent/conflicting code in the earlier sites I made, as I wasn't that experienced yet.
I haven't really been able to clean that up as I've been working more on newer files as of lately.

The reactive design was tested on my laptop, my monitors at home and the monitors we have here.
The site currently doesn't look good on phones and I can't guarantee that it looks good on anything else I haven't tested yet.

Sometimes the scaling on the live site was a bit off, I'm pretty sure I was able to fix all of those inconsistencies, but if something
looks a bit off or doesn't fit the scaling of other elements, I'd maybe recommend checking the site locally.

The whole "Wired" section of the website is hugely inspired by the anime "Serial Experiments Lain" and has this eerie aesthetic on purpose.
